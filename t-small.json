        "question": "how to prevent high blood pressure",
        "answer": "two key measures are used to determine if someone is overweight or obese these are body mass index or bmi and waist circumference body mass index bmi is a measure of weight in relation to height and provides an estimate of your total body fat as your bmi goes up so do your chances of getting high blood pressure heart disease and other health problems a bmi below 185 is a sign that you are underweight between 185 and 249 is in the healthy range between 25 and 299 is considered overweight of 30 or more is considered obese below 185 is a sign that you are underweight between 185 and 249 is in the healthy range between 25 and 299 is considered overweight of 30 or more is considered obese see the body mass index table available from the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi body mass index bmi applies to both men and women but it does have some limits it may overestimate body fat in in someone who is very muscular or who has swelling from fluid retention called edema it may underestimate body fat in older persons and others who have lost muscle mass it may overestimate body fat in in someone who is very muscular or who has swelling from fluid retention called edema it may underestimate body fat in older persons and others who have lost muscle mass thats why waist measurement is often checked as well another reason is that too much body fat in the stomach area also increases disease risk a waist measurement of more than 35 inches in women and more than 40 inches in men is considered high"
