    {
        "question": "How is rabies transmitted? What more can you tell about this?",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - Rabies is transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal, usually via bites or scratches. The virus enters the body through broken skin and travels through the nervous system. More details: [Additional information]."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can rabies be prevented in dogs? Can you explain further?",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - Yes, rabies can be prevented through vaccination. Dogs should receive their rabies vaccine as part of their routine vaccination schedule to protect them from this fatal disease. Further insights include: [Supplementary details]."

        "question": "What are the stages of rabies in dogs? Can you explain further?",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - Rabies in dogs typically progresses through three stages: the prodromal stage (behavioral changes), the excitatory stage (aggression, hallucinations), and the paralytic stage (paralysis, death). More details: [Additional information]."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is rabies diagnosed in dogs? Please elaborate.",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - Rabies is diagnosed through laboratory tests on brain tissue. However, diagnosis is usually based on clinical signs and history of exposure.

    {
        "question": "Can rabies be prevented in dogs? Could you provide more details?",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - Yes, rabies can be prevented through vaccination. Dogs should receive their rabies vaccine as part of their routine vaccination schedule to protect them from this fatal disease. Further insights include: [Supplementary details]."

    {
        "question": "What are the symptoms of rabies in dogs? What more can you tell about this?",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - Symptoms of rabies in dogs include behavioral changes, aggression, difficulty swallowing, excessive salivation, and paralysis. Also, consider this: [Extra context]."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is rabies transmitted? What more can you tell about this?",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - Rabies is transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal, usually via bites or scratches. The virus enters the body through broken skin and travels through the nervous system. Also, consider this: [Extra context]."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can rabies be prevented in dogs? What more can you tell about this?",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - Yes, rabies can be prevented through vaccination. Dogs should receive their rabies vaccine as part of their routine vaccination schedule to protect them from this fatal disease. Further insights include: [Supplementary details]."

    {
        "question": "What should you do if a dog is bitten by a potentially rabid animal? Please elaborate.",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - If a dog is bitten by a potentially rabid animal, it is crucial to seek veterinary care immediately. The vet may administer a rabies booster shot and assess the need for additional treatment based on the exposure risk. Also, consider this: [Extra context]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the incubation period for rabies in dogs? Could you provide more details?",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - The incubation period for rabies in dogs can vary, but it is typically between one to three months. During this time, the virus travels from the site of the bite to the central nervous system before symptoms appear. Further insights include: [Supplementary details]."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can humans get rabies from dogs? Please elaborate.",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - Yes, humans can contract rabies from dogs if they are bitten or scratched by an infected animal.

    {
        "question": "What are the stages of rabies in dogs? Can you explain further?",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - Rabies in dogs typically progresses through three stages: the prodromal stage (behavioral changes), the excitatory stage (aggression, hallucinations), and the paralytic stage (paralysis, death). More details: [Additional information]."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is rabies diagnosed in dogs? Could you provide more details?",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - Rabies is diagnosed through laboratory tests on brain tissue. However, diagnosis is usually based on clinical signs and history of exposure. Testing for rabies in living animals is challenging, and post-mortem examination is often required. Further insights include: [Supplementary details]."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the treatment for rabies in dogs? What more can you tell about this?",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - There is no effective treatment for rabies once clinical symptoms have appeared. Rabies is almost always fatal once it reaches the symptomatic stage. Prevention through vaccination is the most effective strategy. Also, consider this: [Extra context]."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can rabies be treated if detected early? Can you explain further?",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - In dogs, once rabies symptoms appear, treatment is not effective. However, if a dog is exposed to rabies and has not shown symptoms, immediate vaccination and possible post-exposure prophylaxis can prevent the disease. Also, consider this: [Extra context]."

    {
        "question": "What are the legal requirements regarding rabies vaccination for dogs? What more can you tell about this?",
        "answer": "Dr. Vikas said that - Rabies vaccination laws vary by region, but most places require dogs to be vaccinated against rabies and have proof of vaccination. Check local regulations for specific requirements in your area. More details: [Additional information]."
