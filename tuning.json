        "question": "what is are high blood pressure",
        "answer": "high blood pressure is a common disease in which blood flows through blood vessels arteries at higher than normal pressures what is blood pressure blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the blood vessels as the heart pumps blood if your blood pressure rises and stays high over time its called high blood pressure high blood pressure is dangerous because it makes the heart work too hard and the high force of the blood flow can harm arteries and organs such as the heart kidneys brain and eyes types of high blood pressure there are two main types of high blood pressure primary and secondary high blood pressure primary or essential high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure this type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines this type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed primary or essential high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure this type of high blood pressure tends to develop over years as a person ages secondary high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines this type usually resolves after the cause is treated or removed measuring blood pressure blood pressure is always given as two numbers the systolic and diastolic pressures both are important systolic pressure is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart beats diastolic pressure is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart is at rest between beats systolic pressure is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart beats diastolic pressure is the pressure of blood against the artery walls when the heart is at rest between beats usually these numbers are written one above or before the other for example 12080 mmhg the top or first number is the systolic and the bottom or second number is the diastolic if your blood pressure is 12080 you say that it is 120 over 80 normal blood pressure normal blood pressure for adults is defined as a systolic pressure below 120 mmhg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mmhg it is normal for blood pressures to change when you sleep wake up or are excited or nervous when you are active it is normal for your blood pressure to increase however once the activity stops your blood pressure returns to your normal baseline range blood pressure normally rises with age and body size newborn babies often have very low blood pressure numbers that are considered normal for babies while older teens have numbers similar to adults abnormal blood pressure abnormal blood pressure is higher than 12080 mmhg if either your systolic or diastolic blood pressure is higher than normal 12080 but not high enough to be considered high blood pressure 14090 you have prehypertension prehypertension is a top number between 120 and 139 or a bottom number between 80 and 89 mmhg for example blood pressure readings of 13882 12870 or 11586 are all in the prehypertension range click the table on the right to see the stages of high blood pressure in adults a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmhg or higher or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmhg or higher is considered high blood pressure or hypertension hypertension is the medical term for high blood pressure if you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease your recommended blood pressure levels are a systolic blood pressure of 130 mmhg or lower and a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mmhg or lower usually has no symptoms high blood pressure is often called the silent killer because it usually has no symptoms occasionally headaches may occur some people may not find out they have high blood pressure until they have trouble with their heart kidneys or eyes when high blood pressure is not diagnosed and treated it can lead to other lifethreatening conditions including heart attack heart failure stroke and kidney failure it can also lead to vision changes or blindness possible complications over time over time high blood pressure can cause your heart to work too hard and become larger or weaker which can lead to heart failure small bulges aneurysms to worsen in your blood vessels common locations for aneurysms are the aorta which is the main artery from the heart the arteries in your brain legs and intestines and the artery leading to your spleen blood vessels in your kidneys to narrow which can cause kidney failure blood vessels in your eyes to burst or bleed which can cause vision changes and can result in blindness arteries throughout your body to harden faster especially those in your heart brain kidneys and legs this can cause a heart attack stroke or

symptoms aneurysms these occur when an abnormal bulge forms in the wall of an artery aneurysms develop and grow for years without causing signs or symptoms until they rupture grow large enough to press on nearby body parts or block blood flow the signs and symptoms that develop depend on the location of the aneurysm chronic kidney disease this disease occurs when blood vessels narrow in the kidneys possibly causing kidney failure cognitive changes research shows that over time higher blood pressure numbers can lead to cognitive changes signs and symptoms include memory loss difficulty finding words and losing focus during conversations eye damage this condition occurs when blood vessels in the eyes burst or bleed signs and symptoms include vision changes or blindness heart attack this occurs when the flow of oxygenrich blood to a section of heart muscle suddenly becomes blocked and the heart doesnt get oxygen the most common warning symptoms of a heart attack are chest pain or discomfort upper body discomfort and shortness of breath heart failure this condition occurs when the heart cant pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs common signs and symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath or trouble breathing feeling tired and swelling in the ankles feet legs abdomen and veins in the neck peripheral arterial disease this is a disease in which plaque builds

readings at several medical appointments to diagnose high blood pressure based on the results of your blood pressure test your health care provider will diagnose prehypertension or high blood pressure if your systolic or diastolic readings are consistently higher than 12080 mmhg once your health care provider determines the severity of your blood pressure he or she can order additional tests to determine if your blood pressure is due to other conditions or medicines or if you have primary high blood pressure health care providers can use this information to develop your treatment plan some people have white coat hypertension this happens when blood pressure readings are only high when taken in a health care providers office compared with readings taken in any other location researchers believe stress which can occur during the medical appointment causes white coat hypertension preparing for the test a blood pressure test is easy and painless and can be done in a health care providers office or clinic to prepare for the test dont drink coffee or smoke cigarettes for 30 minutes prior to the test go to the bathroom before the test a full bladder can change the reading sit for 5 minutes before the test dont drink coffee or smoke cigarettes for 30 minutes prior to the test go to the bathroom before the test a full bladder can change the reading sit for 5 minutes before the test to track blood pressure readings over a period of time the health care provider may ask you to come into the office on different days and at different times to take your blood pressure the health care provider also may ask you to check readings at home or at other locations that have blood pressure equipment and to keep a written log of all your results whenever you have an appointment with the health care provider be sure to bring your log of blood pressure readings ask the doctor or nurse to tell you your blood pressure reading in numbers and to explain what the numbers mean write down your numbers or ask the doctor or nurse to write them down for you write down your readings ask the doctor or nurse to tell you your blood pressure reading in numbers and to explain what the numbers mean write down your numbers or ask the doctor or nurse to write them down for you the wallet card on the right can be printed out and used to record your blood pressure numbers checking your own blood pressure you can also check your blood pressure at home with a home blood pressure measurement device or monitor it is important that the blood pressure cuff fits you properly and that you understand how to use the monitor a cuff that is too small for example can give you a reading that is higher than your actual blood pressure your doctor nurse or pharmacist can help you check the cuff size and teach you how to use it correctly you may also ask for their help in choosing the right blood pressure monitor for you blood pressure monitors can be bought at discount chain stores and drug stores when you are taking your blood pressure at home sit with your back supported and your feet flat on the floor rest your arm on a table at the level of your heart after a diagnosis if youre diagnosed with high blood pressure your doctor will prescribe treatment your blood pressure will be tested again to see how the treatment affects it once your blood pressure is under control youll still need treatment under control means that your blood pressure numbers are in the normal range your doctor will likely recommend routine blood pressure tests he or she can tell you how often you should be tested the sooner you find out about high blood pressure and treat it the better early treatment may help you avoid problems such as heart attack stroke and kidney failure see tips for

medicines for their patients in particular they look at the type of pain the patient may be having and any possible side effects from the drugs for pain relief doctors usually start with acetaminophen because the side effects are minimal if acetaminophen does not relieve pain then nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen may be used some nsaids are available over the counter while more than a dozen others including a subclass called cox2 inhibitors are available only with a prescription other medications including corticosteroids hyaluronic acid and topical creams are also used reduce the risks of nsaid use most medicines used to treat osteoarthritis have side effects so it is important for people to learn about the medicines they take for example people over age 65 and those with any history of ulcers or stomach bleeding should use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or nsaids with caution there are measures you can take to help reduce the risk of side effects associated with nsaids these include taking medications with food and avoiding stomach irritants such as alcohol tobacco and caffeine in some cases it may help to take another medication along with an nsaid to coat the stomach or block stomach acids although these measures may help they are not always completely effective for more tips on how older adults can avoid side effects see side

plastic and ceramic material some prostheses are joined to bone surfaces with special cements others have porous surfaces and rely on the growth of bone into that surface a process called biologic fixation to hold them in place artificial joints can last 10 to 15 years or longer surgeons choose the design and components of prostheses according to their patients weight sex age activity level and other medical conditions joint replacement advances in recent years have included the ability in some cases to replace only the damaged part of the knee joint leaving undamaged parts of the joint intact and the ability to perform hip replacement through much smaller incisions than previously possible for more on joint replacement see the hip replacement and knee replacement topics deciding on surgery the decision to use surgery depends on several factors including the patients age occupation level of disability pain intensity and the degree to which arthritis interferes with his or her

        "question": "what is are problems with taste",
        "answer": "taste or gustation is one of our most robust senses although there is a small decline in taste in people over 60 most older people will not notice it because normal aging does not greatly affect our sense of taste problems with taste occur less frequently than problems with smell how our sense of taste works our sense of taste along with our sense of smell is part of our chemical sensing system normal taste occurs when tiny molecules released by chewing or the digestion of food stimulate special sensory cells in the mouth and throat these taste cells or gustatory cells send messages through three specialized taste nerves to the brain where specific tastes are identified damage to these nerves following head injury can lead to taste loss the taste cells are clustered within the taste buds of the tongue and roof of the mouth and along the lining of the throat many of the small bumps that can be seen on the tip of the tongue contain taste buds at birth we have about 10000 taste buds scattered on the back sides and tip of the tongue after age 50 we may start to lose taste buds five taste sensations we can experience five basic taste sensations sweet sour bitter salty and umami or savory umami is the taste we get from glutamate a building block of protein found in chicken broth meat stock and some cheeses umami is also the taste associated wtih msg monosodium glutamate that is often added to foods as a flavor enhancer the five taste qualities combine with other oral sensations such as texture spiciness temperature and aroma to produce what is commonly referred to as flavor it is flavor that lets us know whether we are eating an apple or a pear flavors and the sense of smell many people are surprised to learn that we recognize flavors largely through our sense of smell try holding your nose while eating chocolate you will be able to distinguish between its sweetness and bitterness but you cant identify the chocolate flavor thats because the distinguishing characteristic of chocolate is largely identified by our sense of smell as aromas are released during chewing food flavor is affected by a head cold or nasal congestion because the aroma of food does not reach the sensory cells that detect odors more information on this topic can be found in the topic problems with smell smell and taste closely linked smell and taste are closely linked senses many people mistakenly believe they have a problem with taste when they are really experiencing a problem with smell it is common for people who lose their sense of smell to say that food has lost its taste this is incorrect the food has lost its aroma but taste remains in older people there is a normal decline in the sense of smell and the taste of food shifts toward blandness this is why people often believe they have a taste problem when taste is impaired problems with taste can have a big impact on an older persons life because taste affects the amount and type of food we eat when there are problems with taste a person may change his or her eating habits some people may eat too much and gain weight while others may eat too little and lose weight a loss of appetite especially in older adults can lead to loss of weight poor nutrition weakened immunity and even death taste helps us detect spoiled food or liquids and it also helps some people detect ingredients they are allergic to a problem with taste can weaken or remove an early warning system that most of us take for granted a distorted sense of taste can be a serious risk factor for illnesses that require sticking to a specific diet loss of taste can cause us to eat too much sugar or salt to make our food taste better this can be a problem for people with such illnesses as diabetes or high blood pressure in severe cases loss of taste can lead to depression taste problems are often temporary when an older person has a problem with taste it is often temporary and minor true taste disorders are uncommon when a problem with taste exists it is usually caused by medications disease some cancer treatments or injury many older people believe that there is nothing they can do about their weakened sense of taste if you think you have a problem with your sense of taste see your doctor depending on the cause of your problem your doctor may be able to suggest ways to regain your sense of taste or to cope with the loss of taste"

adults and they typically start in early life however anyone can develop an anxiety disorder at any time below are risk factors for these anxiety disorders generalized anxiety disorder gad social anxiety disorder social phobia panic disorder generalized anxiety disorder gad social anxiety disorder social phobia panic disorder generalized anxiety disorder risk factors generalized anxiety disorder gad affects about 68 million american adults including twice as many women as men the disorder develops gradually and can begin at any point in the life cycle although the years of highest risk are between childhood and middle age the average age of onset is 31 years old social phobia risk factors social phobia affects about 15 million american adults women and men are equally likely to develop the disorder which usually begins in childhood or early adolescence there is some evidence that genetic factors are involved panic disorder risk factors panic disorder affects about 6 million american adults and is twice as common in women as men panic attacks often begin in late adolescence or early adulthood but not everyone who experiences panic attacks will develop panic disorder many people have just one attack and never have another the tendency to develop panic attacks appears to be inherited diagnosis can be difficult there are a number of reasons why it can be difficult to accurately diagnose an anxiety disorder in older adults anxiety disorders among older adults frequently occur at the same time as other illnesses such as depression diabetes heart disease or a number of other medical illnesses problems with cognition thinking and changes in life circumstances can also complicate matters sometimes the physical signs of these illnesses can get mixed up with the symptoms of anxiety making it difficult to determine if a person has a true anxiety disorder for instance a person with heart disease sometimes has chest pain which can also be a symptom of a panic disorder anxiety disorders among older adults frequently occur at the same time as other illnesses such as depression diabetes heart disease or a number of other medical illnesses problems with cognition thinking and changes in life circumstances can also complicate matters sometimes the physical signs of these illnesses can get mixed up with the symptoms of anxiety making it difficult to determine if a person has a true anxiety disorder for instance a person with heart disease sometimes has chest pain which can also be a symptom of a panic disorder doctors can have difficulty distinguishing between anxiety caused by adapting to difficult life changes and a true anxiety disorder for example if you fell and broke a hip you may be justifiably fearful of going out for a while but that would not mean you have developed an anxiety disorder doctors can have difficulty distinguishing between anxiety caused by adapting to difficult life changes and a true anxiety disorder for example if you fell and broke a hip you may be justifiably fearful of going out for a while but that would not mean you have developed an anxiety disorder sometimes the worrying symptoms of a medical illness can lead to an anxiety disorder or sometimes the side effects of medication can cause anxiety also a disability or a change in lifestyle caused by a medical illness may lead to an anxiety disorder muscle tightness feeling very tense all the time and difficulty sleeping can also be symptoms of a physical illness or an anxiety disorder complicating diagnosis sometimes the worrying symptoms of a medical illness can lead to an anxiety disorder or sometimes the side effects of medication can cause anxiety also a disability or a change in lifestyle caused by a medical illness may

disorder social phobia generalized anxiety disorder gad diagnosis gad can be diagnosed once a person worries excessively about a variety of everyday problems for at least 6 months people with gad may visit a doctor many times before they find out they have this disorder they ask their doctors to help them with headaches or trouble falling asleep which can be symptoms of gad but they dont always get the help they need right away it may take doctors some time to be sure that a person has gad instead of something else social phobia diagnosis a doctor can tell that a person has social phobia if the person has had symptoms for at least 6 months social phobia usually starts during youth without treatment it can last for many years or a lifetime panic disorder diagnosis people with panic disorder may sometimes go from doctor to doctor for years and visit the emergency room repeatedly before someone correctly diagnoses their condition this is unfortunate because panic disorder is one of the most treatable of all the anxiety disorders responding in most cases to certain kinds of medication or certain kinds of cognitive psychotherapy which help change thinking patterns that lead to fear and anxiety if you have symptoms anxiety disorders are treatable if you think you have an anxiety disorder talk to your family doctor your doctor should do an exam to make sure that another physical problem isnt causing the symptoms the doctor may refer you to a mental health specialist you should feel comfortable talking with the mental health specialist you choose if you do not seek help elsewhere once you find a mental health specialist you are comfortable with you should work as a team and make a plan to treat your anxiety disorder together talk about about past treatment people with anxiety disorders who have already received treatment for an anxiety disorder should tell their doctor about that treatment in detail if they received medication they should tell their doctor what medication was used what the dosage was at the beginning of treatment whether the dosage was increased or decreased while they were under treatment what side effects may have occurred and whether the treatment helped them become less anxious if they received psychotherapy they should describe the type of therapy how often they attended sessions and whether the therapy was useful"

all of the cells in your body insulin is a chemical a hormone made by the pancreas the pancreas releases insulin into the blood insulin helps the glucose from food get into your cells if your body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin doesnt work the way it should glucose cant get into your cells it stays in your blood instead your blood glucose level then gets too high causing prediabetes or diabetes types of diabetes there are three main kinds of diabetes type 1 type 2 and gestational diabetes the result of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is the same glucose builds up in the blood while the cells are starved of energy over the years high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels oftentimes leading to complications such as heart disease stroke blindness kidney disease

muscle and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the bodys cells to use for energy as a result the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells at first the pancreas keeps up

kidney failure the goal of treatment changes since the kidneys no longer work well enough to maintain health it is necessary to choose a treatment in order to maintain health there are two main options for this dialysis and transplantation some patients choose not to treat kidney failure with dialysis or a transplant instead they receive supportive care to treat their symptoms before you and

products and extra fluid out of your body in hemodialysis your blood passes through a filter outside of your body and the clean blood is returned to your body in hemodialysis blood is run through a filter outside of your body and the clean blood is returned to the body hemodialysis is usually done at a dialysis center three times a week but it can also be done at home each session usually lasts between three and four hours peritoneal dialysis is another way to remove wastes from your blood this kind of dialysis uses the lining of your abdominal cavity the space in your body that holds organs like the stomach intestines and liver to filter your blood it works by putting a special fluid into your abdomen that absorbs waste products in your blood as it passes through small blood vessels in this lining this fluid with the waste products is then drained away a key benefit of peritoneal dialysis is that it can be done at home while you sleep hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis do not cure kidney failure they are treatments that help replace the function of the kidneys and may help you feel better and live longer but for some people who have many health problems and are age 75 or older

be a special challenge for older adults especially those who have other diseases or conditions for example for hemodialysis a person must be able to leave home travel to the dialysis facility and sit for 4 hours during treatment peritoneal dialysis can be done at home but someone needs to help often older adults need help with some or all of these activities they and their families need to think about these issues as they choose treatment options and living facilities learn more about dialysis eating diet and nutrition on dialysis for people who are on dialysis or approaching total kidney failure adequate nutrition is important for maintaining energy strength healthy sleep patterns bone health heart health and good mental health the diet should be based on the type of treatment the person is getting people on hemodialysis must watch how much fluid they drink and avoid eating foods with too much sodium potassium and phosphorus in contrast people on peritoneal dialysisa type of dialysis that uses the lining of the abdomen or belly to filter the blood inside the bodymay be able to eat more potassiumrich foods because peritoneal dialysis removes potassium from the body more efficiently than hemodialysis both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can remove proteins from the body so anyone on either form of dialysis should eat proteinrich foods such as meat fish and eggs

        "answer": "alzheimers disease is a brain disease that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and eventually the ability to carry out the simplest tasks it begins slowly and gets worse over time currently it has no cure a common cause of dementia alzheimers disease is the most common cause of dementia among older people dementia is a loss of thinking remembering and reasoning skills that interferes with a persons daily life and activities dementia ranges in severity from the mild stage when it is just beginning to affect a persons functioning to the severe stage when the person must depend completely on others for basic care estimates vary but experts suggest that more than 5 million americans may have alzheimers disease alzheimers is currently ranked as the sixth leading cause of death in the united states but recent estimates indicate that the disorder may rank third just behind heart disease and cancer as a cause of death for older people risk increases with age in most people with alzheimers symptoms first appear in their mid60s and the risk of developing the disease increases with age while younger people in their 30s 40s and 50s may get alzheimers disease it is much less common it is important to note that alzheimers disease is not a normal part of aging the course of alzheimers diseasewhich symptoms appear and how quickly changes occurvaries from person to person the time from diagnosis to death varies too it can be as little as 3 or 4 years if the person is over 80 years old when diagnosed or as long as 10 years or more if the person is younger memory problems one of the first signs memory problems are typically one of the first signs of alzheimers disease though initial symptoms may vary from person to person a decline in other aspects of thinking such as finding the right words visionspatial issues and impaired reasoning or judgment may also signal the very early stages of alzheimers disease people with alzheimers have trouble doing everyday things like driving a car cooking a meal or paying bills they may ask the same questions over and over get lost easily lose things or put them in odd places and find even simple things confusing some people become worried angry or violent other reasons for memory issues not all people with memory problems have alzheimers disease mild forgetfulness can be a normal part of aging some people may notice that it takes longer to learn new things remember certain words or find their glasses thats different from a serious memory problem which makes it hard to do everyday things sometimes memory problems are related to health issues that are treatable for example medication side effects vitamin b12 deficiency head injuries or liver or kidney disorders can lead to memory loss or possibly dementia emotional problems such as stress anxiety or depression can also make a person more forgetful and may be mistaken for dementia read more about causes of memory loss and how to keep your memory sharp mild cognitive impairment some older people with memory or other thinking problems have a condition called mild cognitive impairment or mci mci can be an early sign of alzheimers but not everyone with mci will develop alzheimers disease people with mci have more memory problems than other people their age but they can still take care of themselves and do their normal activities signs of mci may include losing things often forgetting to go to events and appointments having more trouble coming up with words than other people the same age losing things often forgetting to go to events and appointments having more trouble coming up with words than other people the same age if you or someone in your family thinks your forgetfulness is getting in the way of your normal routine its time to see your doctor seeing the doctor when you first start having memory problems can help you find out whats causing your forgetfulness learn more about mild cognitive impairment mci what happens to the brain in alzheimers alzheimers disease is named after dr alois alzheimer a german doctor in 1906 dr alzheimer noticed changes in the brain tissue of a woman who had died of an unusual mental illness after she died he examined her brain and found many abnormal clumps now called amyloid plaques and tangled bundles of fibers now called neurofibrillary or tau tangles plaques and tangles in the brain are two of the main features of alzheimers disease another is the loss of connections between nerve cells neurons in the brain neurons send messages between different parts of the brain and from the brain to muscles and organs in the body it seems likely that damage to the brain starts 10 years or more before memory or other thinking problems become obvious during the earliest stage of alzheimers people are free of symptoms but harmful changes are taking place in the brain the damage at first appears to take place in cells of the hippocampus the part of the brain essential in forming memories abnormal protein deposits form plaques and tangles in the brain oncehealthy nerve cells stop functioning lose connections with each other and die as more nerve cells die other parts of the brain begin to shrink by the final stage of alzheimers damage is widespread and brain tissue has shrunk significantly get more details about alzheimers disease"

alzheimers takes many years to develop and becomes increasingly severe over time memory problems a common early sign memory problems are typically one of the first signs of alzheimers disease however not all memory problems are caused by alzheimers if you or someone in your family thinks your forgetfulness is getting in the way of your normal routine its time to see your doctor he or she can find out whats causing these problems a person in the early mild stage of alzheimers disease may find it hard to remember things ask the same questions over and over get lost in familiar places lose things or put them in odd places have trouble handling money and paying bills take longer than normal to finish daily tasks have some mood and personality changes find it hard to remember things ask the same questions over and over get lost in familiar places lose things or put them in odd places have trouble handling money and paying bills take longer than normal to finish daily tasks have some mood and

reasoning or judgment trouble finding the right words vision and spatial issues impaired reasoning or judgment see a chart that compares signs of alzheimers disease with signs of normal aging later signs of alzheimers as alzheimers disease progresses to the moderate stage memory loss and confusion grow worse and people may have problems recognizing family and friends other symptoms at this stage may include difficulty learning new things and coping with new situations trouble carrying out tasks that involve multiple steps like getting dressed impulsive behavior forgetting the names of common things hallucinations delusions or paranoia wandering away from home difficulty learning new things and coping with new situations trouble carrying out tasks that involve multiple steps like getting dressed impulsive behavior forgetting the names of common things hallucinations delusions or paranoia wandering away from home symptoms of severe alzheimers as alzheimers disease becomes more severe people lose the ability to communicate they may sleep more lose weight and have trouble swallowing often they are incontinentthey cannot control their bladder andor bowels eventually they need total care benefits of early diagnosis an early accurate diagnosis of alzheimers disease helps people and their families plan for the future it gives them time to discuss care options find support and make legal and financial arrangements while the person with alzheimers can still take part in making decisions also even though no medicine or other treatment can stop or slow the disease early diagnosis offers the best chance to treat the symptoms how alzheimers is diagnosed the only definitive way to diagnose alzheimers disease is to find out whether plaques and tangles exist in brain tissue to look at brain tissue doctors perform a brain autopsy an examination of the brain done after a person dies doctors can only make a diagnosis of possible or probable alzheimers disease while a person is alive doctors with special training can diagnose alzheimers disease correctly up to 90 percent of the time doctors who can diagnose alzheimers include geriatricians geriatric psychiatrists and neurologists a geriatrician specializes in the treatment of older adults a geriatric psychiatrist specializes in mental problems in older adults a neurologist specializes in brain and nervous system disorders to diagnose alzheimers disease doctors may ask questions about overall health past medical problems ability to carry out daily activities and changes in behavior and personality conduct tests to measure memory problem solving attention counting and language skills carry out standard medical tests such as blood and urine tests perform brain scans to look for anything in the brain that does not look normal ask questions about overall health past medical problems ability to carry out daily activities and changes in behavior and personality conduct tests to measure memory problem solving attention counting and language skills carry out standard medical tests such as blood and urine tests perform brain scans to look for anything in the brain that does not look normal test results can help doctors know if there are other possible causes of the persons symptoms for example thyroid problems drug reactions depression brain tumors head injury and bloodvessel disease in the brain can cause symptoms similar to those of alzheimers many of these other conditions can be treated successfully new diagnostic methods being studied researchers are exploring new ways to help doctors diagnose alzheimers disease earlier and more accurately some studies focus on changes in a persons memory language and other mental functions others look at changes in blood spinal fluid and brainscan results that may detect alzheimers years before symptoms appear watch a video that explains changes in diagnostic guidelines for alzheimers"

niasupported alzheimers research basic research basic research seeks to identify the cellular molecular and genetic processes that lead to alzheimers disease basic research has focused on two of the main signs of alzheimers disease in the brain plaques and tangles plaques are made of a protein called betaamyloid and form abnormal clumps outside nerve cells in the brain tangles are made from a protein called tau and form twisted bundles of fibers within nerve cells in the brain scientists are studying how plaques and tangles damage nerve cells in the brain they can see betaamyloid plaques and tau tangles by making images of the brains of living people such imaging has led to clinical trials that are looking at ways to remove betaamyloid from the human brain or halt its production before more brain damage occurs scientists are also exploring the very earliest brain changes in the disease process findings will help them better understand the causes of alzheimers as they learn more they are likely to come up with better targets for further research over time this might lead to more effective therapies to delay or prevent the disease genetics is another important area of basic research discovering more about the role of genes that increase or decrease the risk of developing alzheimers will help researchers answers questions such as what makes the disease process begin and why do some people with memory and other thinking problems develop alzheimers disease while others do not genetics research helps scientists learn how riskfactor genes interact with other genes and lifestyle or environmental factors to affect alzheimers risk this research also helps identify people who are at high risk for developing alzheimers and can participate in clinical research on new prevention and treatment approaches translational research translational research allows new knowledge from basic research to be applied to a clinical research setting an important goal of alzheimers translational research is to increase the number and variety of potential new medicines and other interventions that are approved for testing in humans scientists also examine medicines approved to treat other diseases to see they might be effective in people with alzheimers the most promising interventions are tested in testtube and animal studies to make sure they are safe and effective

more fully in daily activities a hearing aid can help people hear more in both quiet and noisy situations however only about one out of five people who would benefit from a hearing aid actually uses one a hearing aid has three basic parts a microphone amplifier and speaker the hearing aid receives sound through a microphone which converts the sound waves to electrical signals and sends them to an amplifier the amplifier increases the power of the signals and then sends them to the ear through a speaker types of hearing aids there are a number of different types of hearing aids to treat

loss is severe and of a certain type your doctor may suggest that you talk to an otolaryngologista surgeon who specializes in ear nose and throat diseasesabout a cochlear implant a cochlear implant is a small electronic device that the surgeon places under the skin and behind the ear the device picks up sounds changes them to electrical signals and sends them past the nonworking part of the inner ear and on to the brain a cochlear implant does not restore or create normal hearing instead it can help people who are deaf or who have a severe hearing loss be more aware of their surroundings and understand speech sometimes well enough to use the telephone learning to interpret sounds from the implant takes time and practice a speechlanguage pathologist and audiologist can help you with this

smart phone or tablet apps and closed circuit systems induction coil loops in places of worship theaters and auditoriums tv listening systems help you listen to the television or the radio without being bothered by other noises around you some hearing aids can be plugged into televisions or stereos to help you hear better new and improved treatments under study researchers are studying the causes of hearing loss as well as new treatments for example they are studying ways to improve hearing aids so that wearers can hear certain sounds more clearly even when a person is surrounded by background noise they are also studying how to improve cochlear implants to enhance a persons ability to understand sounds and they are conducting a study on twins aged 50 and over to determine the

normal functioning and causes pain for both the person with depression and those who care about him or her doctors call this condition depressive disorder or clinical depression depression in older adults important life changes that happen as we get older may cause feelings of uneasiness stress and sadness for instance the death of a loved one moving from work into retirement or dealing with a serious illness can leave people feeling sad or anxious after a period of adjustment many older adults can regain their emotional balance but others do not and may develop depression depression is a common problem among older adults but it is not a normal part of aging in fact studies show that most older adults feel satisfied with their lives despite having more physical ailments however when older adults do suffer from depression it may be overlooked because they may be less willing to talk about feelings of sadness or grief or they may show different less obvious symptoms and doctors may be less likely to suspect or spot it sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish grief from major depression grief after loss of a loved one is a normal reaction to the loss and generally does not require professional mental health treatment however grief that lasts for a very long time following a loss may require treatment test depression and suicide though it is widely believed that suicide more often affects young people suicide is a serious problem among older adults too particularly among older men and depression is usually a major contributing factor adults 65 and older have a suicide rate that is higher than the rate for the national population but there are some major differences between older men and women while suicide rates for older women are somewhat lower than those for young and middleaged women rates among men 75 and older are higher than those for younger men in fact white men age 85 and older have the highest suicide rate in the united states types of depression there are several types of depression the most common types are major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder major depressive disorder also called major depression or clinical depression is characterized by a combination of symptoms that interfere with a persons ability to work sleep concentrate eat and enjoy activities he or she once liked major depression prevents a person from functioning normally an episode of major depression may occur only once in a persons lifetime but more often it recurs throughout a persons life dysthymic disorder also called dysthymia is

adults it includes less severe but clear symptoms of depression that fall short of being major depression or dysthymia having subsyndromal depression may increase a persons risk of developing major depression psychotic depression occurs when a person has severe depression plus some form of psychosis such as having disturbing false beliefs or a break with reality delusions or hearing or seeing

        "answer": "treating older adults studies show that the majority of older adults with depression improve when they receive treatment with an antidepressant psychotherapy or a combination of both in addition research has indicated that treating depression in older adults often improves the outcomes of coexisting medical conditions some research has also suggested that the risk for developing depression in people who have had a stroke may be reduced if they receive preventative treatment with an antidepressant or talk therapy special considerations however there are some special considerations that doctors must take into account when treating older adults the commonly prescribed medications for depression may not work well for some older adults because they may interact unfavorably with other medications being taken for other conditions some older adults with depression may also have some problems thinking clearly and these individuals often respond poorly to the drugs which form of treatment is most effective many older adults prefer to get counseling or psychotherapy for depression rather than add more medications to those they are already taking for other conditions research suggests that for older adults psychotherapy is just as likely to be an effective first treatment for depression as taking an antidepressant there is a great deal of evidence indicating that cognitivebehavioral therapy cbt including a version called problem solving therapy may be an especially useful type of psychotherapy for treating older adults and improving their quality of life however a practical issue to consider when deciding on treatment is that it may be harder for many older people to find or be able to travel to meetings with a welltrained psychotherapist than to get a prescription for antidepressant medication from their primary care doctor also some research suggests that treatment with medication may be more effective if the depression is quite severe or if the older adult is coping with other serious illnesses overall research has suggested that when possible a combination of medication and psychotherapy treatment is likely to be most effective in treating depression in older adults and in particular for reducing the number of new episodes latelife depression is often undiagnosed despite progress in treatment research latelife depression often goes undiagnosed or is inadequately treated in older adults in fact several studies have found that up to 75 percent of older adults who die by suicide had visited their primary care doctors within one month of their deaths collaborative or comprehensive care may lead to better treatment results collaborative care the prevention of suicide in primary care

symptoms side effects of medication and progress the study found that those participants who had casemanaged care got better more quickly had longer periods without depression and in general responded better to treatment than those who did not have casemanaged care another study called the improving mood promoting access to collaborative treatment impact trial also found that collaborative care was more effective than usual care and was less expensive over the long run as well improving diagnosis of depression several studies are looking at ways to help older adults get better access to depression treatment one is developing and testing an education and intervention program to help primary care clinics and providers identify and treat latelife depression another study found that depressed older adults who had a care manager monitor their symptoms side effects and progress got better more quickly and stayed better longer than those who did not have casemanaged care still other

        "question": "what is are problems with smell",
        "answer": "our sense of smell helps us enjoy life we delight in the aromas of our favorite foods or the fragrance of flowers our sense of smell also is a warning system alerting us to danger signals such as a gas leak spoiled food or a fire any loss in our sense of smell can have a negative effect on our quality of life it also can be a sign of more serious health problems aging and smell loss problems with smell increase as people get older and they are more common in men than women in one study nearly onequarter of men ages 6069 had a smell disorder while about 11 percent of women in that age range reported a problem many older people are not even aware that they have a problem with their sense of smell because the changes occur gradually over several years they may not even notice that they are experiencing a loss of smell until there is an incident in which they dont detect food that has spoiled or the presence of dangerous smoke how our sense of smell works the sense of smell or olfaction is part of our chemical sensing system along with the sense of taste normal smell occurs when odors around us like the fragrance of flowers or the smell of baking bread stimulate the specialized sensory cells called olfactory sensory cells olfactory sensory cells are located in a small patch of tissue high inside the nose odors reach the olfactory sensory cells in two pathways the first pathway is by inhaling or sniffing through your nose when people think about smell they generally think of this pathway the second pathway is less familiar it is a channel that connects the roof of the throat region to the nose when we chew our food aromas are released that access olfactory sensory cells through this channel if you are congested due to a head cold or sinus infection this channel is blocked which temporarily affects your ability to appreciate the flavors of food types of smell disorders people who experience smell disorders either have a decrease in their ability to smell or changes in the way they perceive odors total smell loss is relatively rare but a decrease in the sense of smell occurs more often especially in older adults a decreased sense of smell may be temporary and treatable with medication there are several types of smell disorders depending on how the sense of smell is affected some people have hyposmia which occurs when their ability to detect certain odors is reduced other people cant detect odor at all which is called anosmia sometimes a loss of smell can be accompanied by a change in the perception of odors this type of smell disorder is called dysosmia familiar odors may become distorted or an odor that usually smells pleasant instead smells foul still others may perceive a smell that isnt present at all which is called phantosmia smell loss due to aging is called presbyosmia some people have hyposmia which occurs when their ability to detect certain odors is reduced other people cant detect odor at all which is called anosmia sometimes a loss of smell can be accompanied by a change in the perception of odors this type of smell disorder is called dysosmia familiar odors may become distorted or an odor that usually smells pleasant instead smells foul still others may perceive a smell that isnt present at all which is called phantosmia smell loss due to aging is called presbyosmia smell loss may signal other conditions problems with our chemical senses may be a sign of other serious health conditions a smell disorder can be an early sign of parkinsons disease alzheimers disease or multiple sclerosis it can also be related to other medical conditions such as obesity diabetes hypertension and malnutrition getting a diagnosis early will help an individual deal better with the underlying condition or disease smell and taste smell and taste are closely linked in the brain but are actually distinct sensory systems true tastes are detected by taste buds on the tongue and the roof of the mouth as well as in the throat region and are limited to sweet salty sour bitter savory and perhaps a few other sensations the loss of smell is much more common than the loss of taste and many people mistakenly believe they have a problem with taste when they are really experiencing a problem with their sense of smell a loss in taste or smell is diagnosed by your doctor using special taste and smell tests smell loss and eating habits when smell is impaired people usually have problems appreciating the subtle flavors of food and say that food is less enjoyable some people change their eating habits some may eat too little and lose weight while others may eat too much and gain weight either way there may be a longterm impact on ones overall health loss of smell may also cause us to eat too much sugar or salt to make our food taste better this can be a problem for people with certain medical conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure in severe cases loss of smell can lead to depression hazards of smell loss research shows that people with a total or partial loss of smell are almost twice as likely as people with normal smell to have certain kinds of accidents the most common types of accidents in order of frequency involve cooking eating or drinking spoiled foods or toxic substances failing to detect gas leaks or fires cooking eating or drinking spoiled foods or toxic substances failing to detect gas leaks or fires if you think you have a problem with your sense of smell see your doctor"

        "answer": "relief is possible although there is no treatment for presbyosmia loss of smell due to aging relief from smell disorders is possible for many older people depending on the cause of your problem with smell your doctor may be able to treat it or suggest ways to cope with it recovering the ability to smell some people recover their ability to smell when they recover from the illness causing their loss of smell some people recover their sense of smell spontaneously for no obvious reason other common causes of smell loss such as the common cold or seasonal allergies are usually temporary smell is regained by waiting for the illness to run its course in some cases nasal obstructions such as polyps can be removed to restore airflow through the nasal passages and restore the sense of smell if your smell disorder cant be successfully treated you might want to seek counseling to help you adjust ask about your medications sometimes a certain medication causes a smell disorder and improvement occurs when the medicine causing the problem is stopped or changed if you take medications ask your doctor if they can affect your sense of smell if so ask if you could substitute other medications or reduce the dose your doctor will work with you to get the medicine you need while trying to reduce unwanted side effects medications that may help your doctor may suggest oral steroid medications such as prednisone which is usually used for a short period of time or topical steroid sprays which can be used for longer periods of time antibiotics are also used to treat nasal infections the effectiveness of both steroids and antibiotics depends greatly on the severity and duration of the nasal swelling or infection often relief is temporary occasionally the sense of smell returns to normal on its own without any treatment steps you can take if you have a problem with smell there are some things you can do wait it out if you have had a cold with a stuffy

health by learning the following warning signs of breast cancer a lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm area a change in the size or shape of the breast a dimple or puckering in the skin of the breast a nipple turned inward into the breast fluid other than breast milk from the nipple especially if its bloody scaly red or swollen skin on the breast nipple or areola the dark area of skin around the nipple dimples in the breast that look like the skin of an orange a lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm area a change in the size or shape of the breast

nipple or areola the dark area of skin around the nipple dimples in the breast that look like the skin of an orange dont ignore symptoms you should see your doctor about any symptoms like these most often they are not cancer but its important to check with the doctor so that any problems can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible some women believe that as they age health problems are due to growing older because of this myth many illnesses go undiagnosed and untreated dont ignore your symptoms because you think they are not important or because you believe they are normal for your age

lowered hopefully this will lower the number of deaths caused by cancer when studying ways to prevent cancer scientists look at risk factors and protective factors anything that increases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer protective factor risk factors some risk factors for cancer can be avoided but many cannot for example both smoking and inheriting certain genes are risk factors for some types of cancer but only smoking can be avoided regular exercise and a healthy diet may be protective factors for some types of cancer avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does not mean that you will not get cancer different ways to prevent cancer are being studied including changing lifestyle or eating habits avoiding things known to cause cancer taking medicine to treat a precancerous condition or to keep cancer from starting changing

assessment and counseling before making this decision the sudden drop in estrogen levels may cause the symptoms of menopause to begin these include hot flashes trouble sleeping anxiety and depression longterm effects include decreased sex drive vaginal dryness and decreased bone density unclear as risk factors it is not clear whether the following affect the risk of breast cancer oral contraceptives taking oral contraceptives the pill may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer in current users this risk decreases over time some oral contraceptives contain estrogen

        "question": "how to diagnose breast cancer",
        "answer": "most cancers in their early most treatable stages do not cause any symptoms that is why its important to have regular tests to check for cancer long before you might notice anything wrong detecting breast cancer through screening when breast cancer is found early it is more likely to be treated successfully checking for cancer in a person who does not have any symptoms is called screening screening tests for breast cancer include among others clinical breast exams and mammograms recent studies have shown that ultrasound and mris may also be useful complementary screening tools particularly in women with mammograms that are not definitive during a clinical breast exam the doctor or other health care professional checks the breasts and underarms for lumps or other changes that could be a sign of breast cancer a mammogram is a special xray of the breast that often can detect cancers that are too small for a woman or her doctor to feel watch the video to learn more about digital mammography and dense breasts to enlarge the video click the brackets in the lower righthand corner to reduce the video press the escape esc button on your keyboard who should have a mammography several studies show that mammography screening has reduced the number of deaths from breast cancer however some other studies have not shown a clear benefit from mammography scientists are continuing to examine the level of benefit that mammography can produce the us preventive services task force uspstf recommends a screening mammography for women 5074 years every two years learn more about the uspstf mammography recommendations here between 5 and 10 percent of mammogram results are abnormal and require more testing most of these followup tests confirm that no cancer was present worried about the cost of a mammogram learn about free and lowcost screenings centers for disease control and prevention how biopsies are performed if needed the most common followup test a doctor will recommend is called a biopsy this is a procedure where a small amount of fluid or tissue is removed from the breast to make a diagnosis a doctor might perform fine needle aspiration a needle or core biopsy or a surgical biopsy with fine needle aspiration doctors numb the area and use a thin needle to remove fluid andor cells from a breast lump if the fluid is clear it may not need to be checked out by a lab for a needle biopsy sometimes called a core biopsy doctors use a needle to remove tissue from an area that looks suspicious on a mammogram but cannot be felt this tissue goes to a lab where a pathologist examines it to see if any of the cells are cancerous in a surgical biopsy a surgeon removes a sample of a lump or suspicious area sometimes it is necessary to remove the entire lump or suspicious area plus an area of healthy tissue around the edges the tissue then goes to a lab where a pathologist examines it under a microscope to check for cancer cells with fine needle aspiration doctors numb the area and use a thin needle to remove fluid andor cells from a breast lump if the fluid is clear it may not need to be checked out by a lab for a needle biopsy sometimes called a core biopsy doctors use a needle to remove tissue from an area that looks suspicious on a mammogram but cannot be felt this tissue goes to a lab where a pathologist examines it to

of healthy tissue around the edges the tissue then goes to a lab where a pathologist examines it under a microscope to check for cancer cells another type of surgical biopsy that removes less breast tissue is called an imageguided needle breast biopsy or stereotactic biopsy eighty percent of us women who have a surgical breast biopsy do not have cancer however women who have breast biopsies are at higher risk of developing breast cancer than women who have never had a breast biopsy other detection methods magnetic resonance imaging or mri and ultrasound are two other techniques which as supplements to standard mammography might help detect breast cancer with greater accuracy genetic detection the most comprehensive study to date of gene mutations in breast cancer published in september 2012 confirmed that there are four primary subtypes of breast cancer each with its own biology the four groups are called intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer and include her2enriched her2e luminal a luma luminal b lumb and basallike the outlook for survival is different for each of these subtypes of breast cancer researchers found that one subtype basallike breast cancer shares many genetic features with a form of ovarian cancer and that both may respond similarly to drugs that reduce tumor growth or target dna repair the authors hope that discovery of these mutations will be an important step in the effort to improve therapies for breast cancer for the time being there are no genetic tests that are commercially available based solely on these findings soon however knowing extensively which breast cancer gene mutations a woman has should help guide precision treatment"

    {
        "question": "what causes parkinsons disease",
        "answer": "a shortage of dopamine parkinsons disease occurs when nerve cells or neurons in an area of the brain that controls movement become impaired andor die normally these neurons produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine but when the neurons die or become impaired they produce less dopamine this shortage of dopamine causes the movement problems of people with parkinsons dopamine is a chemical messenger or neurotransmitter dopamine is responsible for transmitting signals between the substantia nigra and multiple brain regions the connection between the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum is critical to produce smooth purposeful movement loss of dopamine in this circuit results in abnormal nervefiring patterns within the brain that cause impaired movement loss of norepinephrine people with parkinsons also have loss of the nerve endings that produce the neurotransmitter norepinephrine norepinephrine which is closely related to dopamine is the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system the sympathetic nervous system controls many automatic functions of the body such as heart rate and blood pressure the loss of norepinephrine might help explain several of the nonmovement features of parkinsons such as fatigue irregular blood pressure decreased gastric motility or movement of food through the digestive tract and postural hypotension postural hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure when a person stands up from a sitting or lyingdown position it may cause dizziness lightheadedness and in some cases loss of balance or fainting lewy bodies in brain cells many brain cells of people with parkinsons contain lewy bodies lewy bodies are unusual deposits or clumps of the brain protein alphasynuclein along with other proteins which are seen upon microscopic examination of the brain researchers do not yet know why lewy bodies form or what role they play in the development of parkinsons the clumps may prevent the cell from functioning normally or they may actually be helpful perhaps by keeping harmful proteins locked up so the cells can function genetic mutations although some cases of parkinsons appear to be hereditary and a few can be traced to specific genetic mutations most cases are sporadic sporadic means the disease occurs randomly and does not seem to run in families many researchers now believe that parkinsons disease results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors scientists have identified several genetic mutations associated with parkinsons including mutations in the alphasynuclein gene they think that many more genes may be linked to the disorder studying the genes responsible for inherited cases of parkinsons can help researchers understand both inherited and sporadic cases the same genes and proteins that are altered in inherited cases may also be altered in sporadic cases by environmental toxins or other factors researchers also hope that discovering genes will help identify new ways of treating parkinsons environmental toxins although researchers increasingly recognize the importance of genetics in parkinsons disease most believe environmental exposures increase a persons risk of developing the disease even in inherited cases exposure to toxins or other environmental factors may influence when symptoms of the disease appear or how the disease progresses there are a number of toxins that can cause parkinsonian symptoms in humans researchers are pursuing the question of whether pesticides and other environmental factors not yet identified also may cause parkinsons disease viruses are another possible environmental trigger for parkinsons mitochondria and free radicals research suggests that mitochondria may play a role in the development of parkinsons disease mitochondria are the energyproducing components of the cell and are major sources of free radicals free radicals are molecules that damage membranes proteins dna and other parts of the cell this damage is called oxidative stress changes to brain cells caused by oxidative stress including free radical damage to dna proteins and fats have been found in people with parkinsons clinical studies now underway test whether agents thought to improve energy metabolism and decrease oxidative stress slow the progression of parkinsons disease recent evidence suggests that mutations in genes linked to parkinsons disease result in mitochondrial dysfunction buildup of harmful proteins other research suggests that the cells protein disposal system may fail in people with parkinsons causing proteins like alphasynuclein to build up to harmful levels and trigger premature cell death additional studies have found that clumps of protein that develop inside brain cells of people with parkinsons may contribute to the death of nerve cells or neurons however the exact role of the protein deposits remains unknown these studies also found that inflammation because of protein accumulation toxins or other factors may play a role in the disease however the exact role of the protein deposits remains unknown researchers are exploring the possibility of vaccine development to decrease or prevent the accumulation of alphasynuclein while mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress inflammation and many other cellular processes may contribute to parkinsons disease scientists still do not know what causes cells that produce dopamine to die genes linked to parkinsons researchers have discovered several genes that are linked to parkinsons disease the first to be identified was alphasynuclein or snca studies have found that lewy bodies from people with the sporadic form of parkinsons contain clumps of alphasynuclein protein this discovery revealed a possible link between hereditary and sporadic forms of the disease other genes linked to parkinsons include park2 park7 pink1 and lrrk2 park2 park7 and pink1 cause rare earlyonset forms of the disease mutations in the lrrk2 gene are common in specific populations including in people with parkinsons in north africa researchers are continuing to study the normal functions and interactions of these genes in order to find clues about how parkinsons develops they also have identified a number of other genes and chromosome regions that may play a role in parkinsons but the nature of these links is not yet clear whole genome wide association studies or gwas of thousands of people with parkinsons disease are now underway to find gene variants that allow for an increased risk of developing parkinsons but are not necessarily causes of this disorder by themselves a recent international study found that two genes containing mutations known to cause rare hereditary forms of parkinsons disease are also associated with the more common sporadic form of the disease this finding came from a gwas which looked at dna samples of european people who had parkinsons disease and from those who did not have the disorder"

symptoms of parkinsons as the effects of normal aging there are no medical tests to definitively diagnose the disease so it can be difficult to diagnose accurately early symptoms early symptoms of parkinsons disease are subtle and occur gradually for example affected people may feel mild tremors or have difficulty getting out of a chair they may notice that they speak too softly or that their handwriting is slow and looks cramped or small this very early period may last a long time before the more classic and obvious symptoms appear friends or family members may be the first to notice changes in someone with early parkinsons they may see that the persons face lacks expression and animation a condition known as masked face or that the person does not move an arm or leg normally they also may notice that the person seems stiff unsteady or unusually slow as the disease progresses as the disease progresses symptoms may begin to interfere with daily activities the shaking or tremor may make it difficult to hold utensils steady or read a newspaper tremor is usually the symptom that causes people to seek medical help people with parkinsons often develop a socalled parkinsonian gait that includes a tendency to lean forward small quick steps as if hurrying forward called festination and reduced swinging of the arms they also may have trouble initiating or continuing movement which is known as freezing symptoms often begin on one side of the body or even in one limb on one side of the body as the disease progresses it eventually affects both sides however the symptoms may still be more severe on one side than on the other four primary symptoms the four primary symptoms of parkinsons are tremor rigidity slowness of movement bradykinesia and impaired balance postural instability tremor often begins in a hand although sometimes a foot or the jaw is affected first it is most obvious when the hand is at rest or when a person is under stress it usually disappears during sleep or improves with a deliberate movement rigidity or a resistance to movement affects most people with parkinsons it becomes obvious when another person tries to move the individuals arm such as during a neurological examination the arm will move only in ratchetlike or short jerky movements known as cogwheel rigidity bradykinesia or the slowing down and loss of spontaneous and automatic movement is particularly frustrating because it may make simple tasks somewhat difficult activities once performed quickly and easily such as washing or dressing may take several hours postural instability or impaired balance causes people with parkinsons to fall easily they also may develop a stooped posture with a bowed head and droopy shoulders tremor often begins in a hand

minor others are not many can be treated with medication or physical therapy no one can predict which symptoms will affect an individual person and the intensity of the symptoms varies from person to person many people note that prior to experiencing motor problems of stiffness and tremor they had symptoms of a sleep disorder constipation decreased ability to smell and restless legs other symptoms include depression emotional changes difficulty swallowing and chewing speech changes urinary problems or constipation skin problems sleep problems dementia or other cognitive problems orthostatic hypotension a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up from a sitting or lying down position muscle cramps and dystonia twisting and repetitive movements pain fatigue and loss of energy sexual dysfunction depression emotional changes difficulty swallowing and chewing speech changes urinary problems or constipation skin problems sleep problems dementia or other cognitive problems orthostatic

dysfunction a number of disorders can cause symptoms similar to those of parkinsons disease people with parkinsonslike symptoms that result from other causes are sometimes said to have parkinsonism while these disorders initially may be misdiagnosed as parkinsons certain medical tests as well as response to drug treatment may help to distinguish them from parkinsons diagnosis can be difficult there are currently no blood or laboratory tests to diagnose sporadic parkinsons disease diagnosis is based on a persons medical history and a neurological examination but the disease can be difficult to diagnose accurately early signs and symptoms of parkinsons may sometimes be dismissed as the effects of normal aging a doctor may need to observe the person for some time until it is clear that the symptoms are consistently present improvement after initiating medication is another important hallmark of parkinsons disease doctors may sometimes request brain scans or laboratory tests to rule out other diseases however computed tomography ct and magnetic resonance imaging mri brain scans of people with parkinsons usually appear normal recently the fda food and drug administration has approved an imaging technique called datscan which may help to increase accuracy of the diagnosis of parkinsons disease since many other diseases have similar features but require different treatments it is very important to make an exact diagnosis as soon as possible to ensure proper treatment"

        "answer": "in recent years research on parkinsons has advanced to the point that halting the progression of the disease restoring lost function and even preventing the disease are all considered realistic goals while the goal of preventing parkinsons disease may take years to achieve researchers are making great progress in understanding and treating it genetics research one of the most exciting areas of parkinsons research is genetics studying the genes responsible for inherited cases can help researchers understand both inherited and sporadic cases of the disease identifying gene defects can also help researchers understand how parkinsons occurs develop animal models that accurately mimic the death of nerve cells in humans identify new approaches to drug therapy improve diagnosis understand how parkinsons occurs develop animal models that accurately mimic the death of nerve cells in humans identify new approaches to drug therapy improve diagnosis researchers funded by the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke are gathering information and dna samples from hundreds of families with members who have parkinsons and are conducting largescale studies to identify gene variants that are associated with increased risk of developing the disease they are also comparing gene activity in parkinsons with gene activity in similar diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy in addition to identifying new genes for parkinsons disease researchers are trying to learn about the function of genes known to be associated with the disease and about how gene mutations cause disease effects of environmental toxins scientists continue to study environmental toxins such as pesticides and herbicides that can cause parkinsons symptoms in animals they have found that exposing rodents to the pesticide rotenone and several other agricultural chemicals can cause cellular and behavioral changes that mimic those seen in parkinsons role of lewy bodies other studies focus on how lewy bodies form and what role they play in parkinsons disease some studies suggest that lewy bodies are a byproduct of a breakdown that occurs within nerve cells while others indicate that lewy bodies are protective helping neurons lock away abnormal molecules that might otherwise be harmful identifying biomarkers biomarkers for parkinsons measurable characteristics that can reveal whether the disease is developing or progressing are another focus of research such biomarkers could help doctors detect the disease before symptoms appear and improve diagnosis of the disease they also would show if medications and other types of therapy have a positive or negative effect on the course of the disease the national disorders of neurological disorders and stroke has developed an initiative the parkinsons disease biomarkers identification network pdbin designed specifically to address these questions and to discover and validate biomarkers for parkinsons disease transcranial therapies researchers are conducting many studies of new or improved therapies for parkinsons disease studies are testing whether transcranial electrical polarization tep or transcranial magnetic stimulation tms can reduce the symptoms of the disease in tep electrodes placed on the scalp are used to generate an electrical current that modifies signals in the brains cortex in tms an insulated coil of wire on the scalp is used to generate a brief electrical current drug discovery a variety of new drug treatments for parkinsons disease are in clinical trials several maob inhibitors including selegiline lazabemide and rasagiline are being tested to determine if they have neuroprotective effects in people with parkinsons disease the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke has launched a broad effort to find drugs to slow the progression of parkinsons disease called netpd or nih exploratory trials in parkinsons disease the first studies tested several compounds one of these creatine is now being evaluated in a larger clinical trial the netpd investigators are testing a highly purified form of creatine a nutritional supplement to find out if it slows the decline seen in people with parkinsons creatine is a widely used dietary supplement thought to improve exercise performance cellular energy is stored in a chemical bond between creatine and a phosphate more recently netpd has initiated pilot studies to test pioglitazone a drug that has been shown to stimulate mitochondrial function because mitochondrial function may be less active in parkinsons disease this drug may protect vulnerable dopamine neurons by boosting mitochondrial function cell implantation another potential approach to treating parkinsons disease is to implant cells to replace those lost in the disease starting in the 1990s researchers conducting a controlled clinical trial of fetal tissue implants tried to replace lost dopamineproducing nerve cells with healthy ones from fetal tissue in order to improve movement and the response to medications while many of the implanted cells survived in the brain and produced dopamine this therapy was associated with only modest functional improvements mostly in patients under the age of 60 some of the people who received the transplants developed disabling dyskinesias that could not be relieved by reducing antiparkinsonian medications stem cells another type of cell therapy involves stem cells some stem cells derived from embryos can develop into any kind of cell in the body while others called progenitor cells are less flexible researchers are developing methods to improve the number of dopamineproducing cells that can be grown from embryonic stem cells in culture other researchers are also exploring whether stem cells from adult brains might be useful in treating parkinsons disease recent studies suggest that some adult cells from skin can be reprogrammed to an embryoniclike state resulting in induced pluripotent stem cells ipsc that may someday be used for treatment of parkinsons in addition development and characterization of cells from people with sporadic or inherited parkinsons may reveal information about cellular mechanisms of disease and identify targets for drug development gene therapy a number of early clinical trials are now underway to test whether gene therapy can improve parkinsons disease genes which are found to improve cellular function in models of parkinsons are inserted into modified viruses the genetically engineered viruses are then injected into the brains of people with parkinsons disease clinical studies have focused on the therapeutic potential of neurotrophic factors including gdnf and neurturin and enzymes that produce dopamine these trials will test whether the viruses by lending to the production of the protective gene product improve symptoms of parkinsons over time the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke also supports the morris k udall centers of excellence for parkinsons disease research program these centers located across the usa study cellular mechanisms underlying parkinsons disease identify and characterize diseaseassociated genes and discover and develop potential therapeutic targets the centers multidisciplinary research environment allows scientists to take advantage of new discoveries in the basic translational and clinical sciences that could lead to clinical advances for parkinsons disease"

widely on the link between cancer and smoking since the 1960s since then study after study has provided more proof that cigarette smoking is the primary cause of lung cancer before cigarette smoking became popular after world war i doctors rarely if ever saw patients with lung cancer but today lung cancer is the leading cause of death by cancer over 85 percent of people with lung cancer developed it because they smoked cigarettes if you smoke if you smoke cigarettes you are at much higher risk for lung cancer than a person who has never smoked the risk of dying from lung cancer is 23 times higher for men who smoke and 13 times higher for women who smoke than for people who have never smoked lung cancer can affect young and old alike stopping smoking greatly reduces your risk for developing lung cancer after you stop your risk levels off ten years after the last cigarette the risk of dying from lung cancer drops by 50 percent which does not mean however that risk is eliminated

down on salt eat fruits and vegetables to increase potassium in your diet exercise more maintain proper weight avoid drugs known to raise blood pressure cut down on salt eat fruits and vegetables to increase potassium in your diet exercise more your doctor may prescribe medicines that help lower blood pressure controlling blood pressure will also help you avoid heart disease diabetes and kidney failure smoking cigarette smoking has been linked to the buildup of fatty substances in the carotid artery the main neck artery supplying blood to the brain blockage of this artery is the leading cause of stroke in americans also nicotine raises blood pressure carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen your blood can carry to the brain and cigarette smoke makes your blood thicker and more likely to clot your doctor can recommend programs and medications that may help you quit smoking by quitting at any age you also reduce your risk of lung disease heart disease and a number of cancers including lung cancer heart disease heart disease including common heart disorders such as coronary artery disease valve defects irregular heart beat and enlargement of one of the hearts chambers can result in blood clots that may break loose and block vessels in or leading to the brain the most common blood vessel disease caused by the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries is called atherosclerosis also known as hardening of the arteries your doctor will treat your heart disease and may also prescribe medication such as aspirin to help prevent the formation of clots your doctor may recommend surgery to clean out a clogged neck artery if you match a particular risk profile high blood cholesterol a high level of total cholesterol in the blood is a major risk factor for heart disease which raises your risk of stroke your doctor may recommend changes in your diet or medicines to lower your cholesterol warning signs or history of stroke experiencing warning signs and having a history of stroke are also risk factors for stroke transient ischemic attacks or tias are brief episodes of stroke warning signs that may last only a few moments and then go away if you experience a tia get help at once call 911 if you have had a stroke in the past its important to reduce your risk of a second stroke your brain helps you recover from a stroke by drawing on body systems that now do double duty that means a second stroke can be twice as bad diabetes having diabetes is another risk factor for stroke you may think this disorder affects only the bodys ability to use sugar or glucose but it also causes destructive changes in the blood vessels throughout the body including the brain also if blood glucose levels are high at the time of a stroke then brain damage is usually more severe and extensive than when blood glucose is wellcontrolled treating diabetes can delay the onset of complications that increase the risk of stroke"

cholesterol work with your doctor to lower it a high level of total cholesterol in the blood is a major risk factor for heart disease which raises your risk of stroke diagnosing stroke physicians have several diagnostic techniques and imaging tools to help diagnose stroke quickly and accurately the first step in diagnosis is a short neurological examination or an evaluation of the nervous system when a possible stroke patient arrives at a hospital a health care professional usually a doctor or nurse will ask the patient or a companion what happened and when the symptoms began blood tests an electrocardiogram and a brain scan such as computed tomography or ct or magnetic resonance imaging or mri will often be done measuring stroke severity one test that helps doctors judge the severity of a stroke is the standardized nih stroke scale developed by the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke at the national institutes of health or nih health care professionals use the nih stroke scale to measure a patients neurological deficits by asking the patient to answer questions and to perform several physical and mental tests other scales include the glasgow coma scale the hunt and hess scale the modified rankin scale and the barthel index diagnostic imaging ct scan health care professionals also use a variety of imaging techniques to evaluate acute stroke patients the most widely used is computed tomography or ct scan sometimes pronounced cat scan which is comprised of a series of crosssectional images of the head and brain ct scans are sensitive for detecting hemorrhage and are therefore useful for differentiating hemorrhagic stroke caused by bleeding in the brain from ischemic stroke caused by a blockage of blood flow to the brain hemorrhage is the primary reason for avoiding thrombolytic therapy drugs that break up or dissolve blood clots the only proven therapy for acute ischemic stroke because thrombolytic therapy might make a hemorrhagic stroke worse doctors must confirm that the acute symptoms are not due to hemorrhage prior to giving the drug a ct scan may show evidence of early ischemia an area of tissue that is dead or dying due to a loss of blood supply ischemic strokes generally show up on a ct scan about six to eight hours after the start of stroke symptoms though not as common in practice ct scans also can be performed with a contrast agent to help visualize a blockage in the large arteries supplying the brain or detect areas of decreased blood flow to the brain because ct is readily available at all hours at most major hospitals produces images quickly and is good for ruling out hemorrhage prior to starting thrombolytic therapy ct is the most widely used diagnostic imaging technique for acute stroke diagnostic imaging mri scan another imaging technique used in acute stroke patients is the magnetic resonance imaging or mri scan mri uses magnetic fields to detect a variety of changes in the brain and blood vessels caused by a stroke one effect of ischemic stroke is the slowing of water movement through the injured brain tissue because mri can show this type of injury very soon after stroke symptoms start mri has proven useful for diagnosing acute ischemic stroke before it is visible on ct mri also allows doctors to visualize blockages in the arteries identify sites of prior stroke and create a stroke treatment and prevention plan differences between ct and mri scans mri and ct are equally accurate for determining when hemorrhage is present the benefit of mri over a ct scan is more accurate and earlier diagnosis of ischemic stroke especially for smaller strokes and transient ischemic attacks tias mri can be more sensitive than ct for detecting other types of neurological disorders that mimic the symptoms of stroke however mri cannot be performed in patients with certain types of metallic or electronic implants such as pacemakers for the heart although increasingly used in the emergency diagnosis of stroke mri is not immediately available at all hours in most hospitals where ct is used for acute stroke diagnosis mri typically takes longer to perform than ct and therefore may not be the first choice when minutes count"

        "question": "how to diagnose stroke",
        "answer": "doctors have several techniques and imaging tools to help diagnose stroke quickly and accurately the first step in diagnosis is a short neurological examination or an evaluation of the nervous system when a possible stroke patient arrives at a hospital a health care professional usually a doctor or nurse will ask the patient or a companion what happened and when the symptoms began blood tests an electrocardiogram and a brain scan such as computed tomography ct or magnetic resonance imaging mri will often be done"

    {
        "question": "what is are stroke",
        "answer": "the most commonly used imaging procedure is the computed tomography or ct scan also known as a cat scan a ct scan is comprised of a series of crosssectional images of the head and brain because it is readily available at all hours at most major hospitals produces images quickly and is good for ruling out hemorrhage prior to starting thrombolytic therapy ct is the most widely used diagnostic imaging technique for acute stroke a ct scan may show evidence of early ischemia an area of tissue that is dead or dying due to a loss of blood supply ischemic strokes generally show up on a ct scan about six to eight hours after the start of stroke symptoms"
    },
    {
        "question": "what is are stroke",
        "answer": "another imaging technique used for stroke patients is the magnetic resonance imaging or mri scan mri uses magnetic fields to detect a variety of changes in the brain and blood vessels caused by a stroke one effect of ischemic stroke is the slowing of water movement through the injured brain tissue an mri can show this type of damage very soon after the stroke symptoms start mri and ct are equally accurate for determining when hemorrhage is present the benefit of mri over a ct scan is more accurate and earlier diagnosis of ischemic stroke especially for smaller strokes and transient ischemic attacks tias also mri can be more sensitive than ct for detecting other types of neurologic disorders that mimic the symptoms of stroke however mri cannot be performed in patients with certain types of metallic or electronic implants such as pacemakers for the heart although increasingly used in the emergency diagnosis of stroke mri is not immediately available at all hours in most hospitals where ct is used for acute stroke diagnosis also mri typically takes longer to perform than ct and therefore may not be the first choice when minutes count"
